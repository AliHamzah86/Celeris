# This is a sample file for the wave data from a spectrum. 
# The maximum number of waves is 100. Anything beyond that will be ignored.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored. Comments are only allowed in the header.
# Anyting above the line starting with '=' is header.
# the data are aligned as below:
# amplitude period theta phase

# All four variables including phase must be given for each wave.
